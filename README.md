**Tutorial for Git/Github/WebStorm** 

**Webstorm :** 
1. Install webstorm and get a license for it by signing up by using a  company/university email or your personal account. install it using thi link : https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/promo/?source=google&medium=cpc&campaign=AMER_en_US-EST_WebStorm_Branded&term=webstorm&content=523713720474&gad_source=1&gclid=Cj0KCQjwu-63BhC9ARIsAMMTLXSODRh--DBqJHZz6OS2LmVPFFG0cjH1mpjzehPHuu-wb4cURVPlYwIaAksoEALw_wcB
2. Open WebStorm and create a new project. 
3. Select a project type ( ex, HTML), and then name your project and hit create. 
4. Make sure to know where the windows are. Project window, editor window, run tool window, and terminal window( for files). 
5. Write the code in the language you selected. 
6. To commit changes and push to remote, you must enable git under VCS( version control). You are probably using github to merge the files, that would be explained when getting to github. 
7. Debug your code using the bug icon that is located right next to your run window. 
8. Run the code you write to make sure it’s working. 
9. If you want to change the theme then just go to files and select settings then behaviors & appearance. 
10. If you wanna use the shortcuts just go to files then select settings and keymap. 

**When done with setting up a webstorm and knowing how to use it. Then install git. 

**GIT tutorial for git commands and for setting up git with github :**

1. Install git if you are a windows user. If mac then go to homebrew and write the command: brew install git. And if you’re a linux user, then write the command sudo apt-get install git in package manager. install it using this link: https://git-scm.com/downloads 
2. Make a new repository for git using the command “ git init ( project name). 
3. Clone a repository using git clone ( github link).
4. If you are in a repository you can add changes and files using git add . or got add ( filename). 
5. Commit the changes you made using ( git commit -m “ whatever you'd like to write”. 
6. You can see what you did using the git log command. 
7. For git and github we don’t just use repositories, but we can make branches in the same repository, so when creating a branch write the git branch ( branch name) command. 
8. If you wanna create a remote repository then just write the git remote add origin ( the file or link) 
9. If you want to go to the branch just simply write the git checkout ( branch name) command. 
10. If you want to merge the branches, you just go back to main by writing the  git checkout main command and then you merge the branch you made using the git merge (branch name) command. 
11. You can push your changes using the git push origin command. 
12. If you want to pull the files then write the command git pull origin ( branch name). 
13. Then everything should go to github. 

Note** if you want to connect git to github then you’ll need the ssh code which you will get from github.

**GitHub tutorial:**
1. search for github using any browser. 
2. Create an account for github and set up your account using an email. 
3. After logging in, create a new repository using the + sign in the dropdown menu in the right corner. Or you can create a new repository by simply clicking on the new button on the left next to (Top Repositories). 
4. Name the repository and write a small description of it. 
5. Make the repository public to be able to make a link to access it. 
6. Add the readme file to write a long description of the project. 
7. Click on create repository
8. You can create new branches by clicking on branches and then add a branch. Main is the default branch. 
9. If you would like to add any files, click on add file and then upload or create a new file and then name the file and write anything you want in it. You can edit the readme file as well. 
10. When putting all of the information in the file, you commit the changes and write a description of what you have done so far. 
11. When committing the changes you can see the changes on the file. 
12. To make the font bold, begin with** or _ _and end with ** or _ _  to make it bold. 
13. After finishing all of that you can go to settings, then pages and select a branch then hit save. This will give you a link to give it to anyone to access your programs. 
14. You can pull requests if you have branches to pull and merge the changes of the files in any 2 branches when clicking on pull requests in the left corner. 
15. You can also get the SSH code for either git or any other apps to use it with github. This allows you to do all of the steps above using a different app.






__PART2 :__

**glossory:**
1. **Branch** : is a separate place to create new code that would not affect the previous or original one in main. It is usually used for developers where they can have the same repository but different branches for different codes.
2. **Clone**: is basically creating new copy or local copy for a remote repository.
3. **Commit** : is a snapshot of the changes we make on our files. It explains what happened or what changes were made each time we change something on the file.
4. **Fetch**: it retrieves updates without merging. It is basically for remote repositories.
5. **GIT**: is a version control system. It sees file changes and projects. We can use git to connect to github. It helps people to connect to projects.
6. **GitHub**: is a platform that manages git repositories and uses git for version control.
7. **Merge**: it combines changes for branches. We can use it to combine any branch changes for another branch.
8. **Merge conflict**: it’s when a problem happens when combining or merging branches and needs to be resolved. Different branches conflict and the merging won’t be successful.
9. **Push**: it’s when we send the commits we make for the files to the remote repository. It’s basically using github and git.
10. **Pull**: it’s merging/retrieving the changes we commit from a remote repository.
11. **Remote**: is a repository that is hosted on a server on the internet.
12. **Repository**: is basically a directory that contains files and the history of them. Like commits, changes, pull requests l, and merge.
